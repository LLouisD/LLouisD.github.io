<P STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately,
because of various events on campus, most hotel rooms in Oxford have
already been booked through block reservations that weekend. However,
any such rooms which remain unclaimed are released a month
beforehand; so you may want to check with some of these hotels after
March 6th.</FONT></P>

(A comprehensive list of nearby hotels)<BR><BR>As an alternative, we
have reserved a block of ten rooms at the Wingate by Wyndham hotel in
West Chester, Ohio. This hotel is about 35 minutes from Oxford by
car; it is located right off I-75 in a pleasant area with lots of
restaurants and amenities nearby. If you make a reservation at this
hotel, be sure to mention Miami University to obtain the reduced rate
of $89 per night. There are many other hotels in this vicinity which
have been collected in this link. </SPAN></SPAN></FONT>
