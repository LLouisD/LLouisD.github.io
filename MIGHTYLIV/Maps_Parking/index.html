			<P>We have arranged for the university to issue a parking pass
			which allows you to park for free in any valid place on campus on
			April 6, but please be aware that this pass does not allow you to
			park for free at a meter, or in the garage. The parking pass
			itself also contains a list of standard rules about handicapped
			spaces, reserved spaces, and yellow curbs.</P>
			<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Click <A HREF="http://www.cas.miamioh.edu/math/mighty/Maps_Parking/MIGHTYparkingpass.pdf">here</A>

			<P>The recommended place to park is the Withrow lot.  To access
			the Withrow lot, drive north on Patterson past High street, then
			turn left on Withrow lane (This is easiest to see on the google
			map at the top of the page).  If you follow Withrow lane to the
			end, you will drive right into Withrow lot.  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>If
			for some strange reason Withrow lot is full, you should use
			Pearson lot or North/West Cook Field lot as back-ups.</FONT></FONT></P>

			<P>The registration/breakfast will be in the lobby <FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">which
			is between rooms 153/156 and room 165 (see pictures below)</SPAN></FONT></FONT>.
			 We will of course have signs directing you to the right place so
			don't worry too much about finding your way after you park.</P>
			<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Here I am
			standing on the south side of High Street looking north at the
			School of Engineering, which is made up of three buildings. 
			Notice the lobbies which connect the buildings.  We will be the
			the lobby which connects the building in the middle to the
			building on the right (which is east).  If you find yourself in a
			building called &quot;Benton Hall,&quot; then you are in the
			building on the left and you have gone too far west.</FONT></FONT></P>
