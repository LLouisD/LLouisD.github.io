Title:  LINEARLY MANY FAULTS IN DUAL-CUBE-LIKE NETWORKS 
Abstract:  
   ARIANA ANGJELI,EDDIE CHENG AND LASZLO LIPTAK
The dual cube were introduced as better interconnections network
than the hypercubes for large scale distributed memory multiprocessors. In
this talk we introduce a generalization of these networks, called
dual-cube-like networks, which preserve the basic structure of dual cubes
and retain many of its topological properties. We investigate structural
properties of these networks beyond simple measures such as connectivity. We
prove that if up to kn-(k(k+1))/2 vertices are deleted from dual-cube-like
n-regular network then the resulting graph will either be connected or will
have large components and small components having at most k-1 vertices in
total,and this result is sharp for k%E2%89%A4n. As an application we derive
additional results such as the cyclic vertex-connectivity and the restricted
vertex-connectivity of these networks.

Title: Packing Tree Factors in Random and Pseudo-Random Graphs
Abstract:  For a fixed graph $H$ with $t$ vertices, an $H$-factor of a graph
$G$ with $n$ vertices is a collection of vertex disjoint (not necessarily
induced) copies of $H$ in $G$ covering all vertices of $G$.  We prove that
certain pseudo-random and random graphs may have almost all of their edges
covered by a collection of edge disjoint $H$-factors in the case where $H$
is a tree.

Title:  Toughness and Hamiltonicity in k-trees 
Abstract:  A chordal graph is a $k$-tree if every maximal clique has order
$k+1$ and every minimal separating set has order $k$.  In this talk we
improve a theorem of Broesma, Xiong & Yoshimoto on toughness in $k$-trees
and consider some related corollaries.

Title:  Throttling zero forcing propagation speed 
Abstract:  Zero forcing is a game played on a graph that starts with a
coloring of the vertices as white and black and at each step any vertex
colored black with a unique neighbor colored white ``forces'' the color of
the white vertex to be come black.  In this talk we look at what happens
when we balance the size of the initial set of vertices colored black and
the length of time that it takes for all vertices to be colored black.  We
also give an example that shows it is possible in some graphs to slow down
the speed of propagation in the graph by choosing larger initial sets.

Title: r-hued Coloring of K4-minor Free Graphs
Abstract:  A list assignment $L$ of $G$ is a mapping that assigns every
vertex $v\in V(G)$ a set $L(v)$ of positive integers. For a given list
assignment $L$ of $G$, an ($L,r$)-coloring of $G$ is a proper coloring $c$
such that for any vertex $v$ with degree $d(v)$, $c(v)\in L(v)$ and $v$ is
adjacent to at least min$\{d(v),r\}$ different colors. The {\it $r$-hued
chromatic number} of $G$, $\chi_{r}(G)$, is the least integer $k$ such that
for any $v \in V(G)$ with $L(v) = \{1,2,\cdots,k\}$, $G$ has an
$(L,r)$-coloring. The {\it $r$-hued list chromatic number} of $G$,
$\chi_{L,r}(G)$, is the least integer $k$ such that for any $v \in V(G)$ and
every list assignment $L$ with $|L(v)| = k$, $G$ has an $(L,r)$-coloring.
Let $K(r)=r+3$ if $2 \le r \le 3$, and  $K(r)=\lfloor 3r/2\rfloor+1$ if
$r\ge 4$. We proved that if $G$ is a $K_4$-minor free graph, then

(i) $\chi_r(G) \le K(r)$, and the bound can be attained;

(ii) $\chi_{L,r}(G) \le K(r)+1$.

Title: Eulerian-connected Graphs 
Abstract:  A graph $G$ is Eulerian-connected if for any $u$ and $v$ in
$V(G)$, $G$ has a spanning $(u,v)$-trail.
A graph $G$ is edge-Eulerian-connected if for any $e'$ and $e''$ in $E(G)$,
$G$ has a spanning $(e',e'')$-trail.
For an integer $r\ge 0$, a graph is called $r$-Eulerian-connected if for any
$X\subseteq E(G)$ with $|X|\le r$,
and for any $u,\ v \in V(G)$, 
$G$ has a spanning $(u,v)$-trail $T$ such that $X\subseteq E(T)$. The
$r$-edge-Eulerian-connectivity of a graph can be defined similarly.
 Let $\theta (r)$ be the minimum value of $k$ such
that every $k$-edge-connected graph is $r$-Eulerian-connected.
 Catlin proved that $\theta(0)=4$. In this talk, we shall show that
$\theta(r)=4$ for $0\le r\le 2$, and $\theta(r)=r+1$ for $r\ge 3$, and show
 some new results on $r$-edge-Eulerian connectivity.

Title:  On Choosability with Separation of Planar Graphs with Forbidden
Cycles 
Abstract:  We study choosability with separation which is a constrained
version of list coloring of graphs. A \emph{$(k,d)$-list assignment} $L$ of
a graph $G$ is a function that assigns to each vertex $v$ a list $L(v)$ of
at least $k$ colors and for any adjacent pair $xy$, the lists $L(x)$ and
$L(y)$ share at most $d$ colors. A graph $G$ is $(k,d)$-choosable if there
exists an $L$-coloring of $G$ for every $(k,d)$-list assignment $L$. This
concept is also known as choosability with separation. We prove that planar
graphs without 4-cycles are $(3,1)$-choosable and that planar graphs without
5-cycles and 6-cycles are $(3,1)$-choosable. In addition, we give an
alternative and slightly stronger proof that triangle-free planar graphs are
$(3,1)$-choosable.

Title:  Extremal $H$-colorings of forests and trees 
Abstract:  Given a finite graph $H$, an $H$-coloring of a finite, simple
graph $G$ (or graph homomorphism) is a map from the vertices of $G$ to the
vertices of $H$ that preserves edge adjacency.  $H$-colorings generalize
many important graph theoretic notions, such as proper $q$-colorings (via $H
= K_{q}$) and independent sets (via $H$ as an edge with a loop on one
endvertex).

Given a family of graphs $\mathcal{G}$ and a graph $H$, which graph(s) in
$\mathcal{G}$ have the largest number of $H$-colorings?  We present several
results for the family of $n$-vertex forests and the family of $n$-vertex
trees.  Numerous open questions remain.

Title: Twin conventions and graph Stirling numbers 
Abstract:  Recently Griffiths asked (and answered) the question: in how many
ways can $n$ sets of twins at a twin convention break into non-empty groups,
with no group allowed to contain a pair of twins? One approach to this
problem leads naturally to the notion of a ``graph Stirling number of the
second kind''. I'll say what we know about these numbers and what we don't,
and then use them to address Griffith's question with ``twins'' replaced by
``triplets'', ``quadruplets'', etc. Partly joint work with Do Trong Thanh.

Title: Rainbow Spanning Subgraphs in Edge-Colored Complete Graphs 
Abstract:  For integers $n$ and $t$, let $r(n,t)$ be the maximum number of
colors in an
edge-coloring of the complete graph $K_n$ that does not contain $t$
edge-disjoint rainbow spanning trees.  Let $s(n,t)$ be the maximum number of
colors in an edge-coloring of $K_n$ containing no rainbow spanning subgraph
with diameter at most $t$.  We determine r(n,t) for
$n>2t+\sqrt{6t-\frac{23}{4}}+\frac52$ and for $n=2t$. We also determine
$s(n,t)$ for all integers $n$ and $t$.

Title: Some lower bounds for the intersection dimension of graphs
Abstract:  The {\it intersection dimension} of a graph with respect to a set
of non-negative integers~$L$ is the small number~$l$ for which there is an
assignment on the vertices to subsets $A_v \subseteq \{1,\dots, l\}$, such
that every two vertices $u,v$ are adjacent if and only if $|A_u \cap A_v|\in
L$.
The {\it bipartite intersection dimension} is defined similarly when the
conditions are considered only for the vertices in different parts. The {\it
absolut dimension} of a graph $G$ is the minimum intersection dimension of
$G$ over all sets $L$. Finding graphs with large (bipartite) absolute
dimension would have important consequences in the complexity theory.
In this talk, we present some lower bounds for the (bipartite) intersection
dimension of a graph with respect to various types $L$ in terms of the
minimum rank of graph.

Title: Multidesigns for Graph-Triples of Order 6 
Abstract:  We call $T=(G_1,G_2,G_3)$ a \emph{graph-triple of order t} if the
$G_i$ are pairwise non-isomorphic graphs on $t$ non-isolated vertices whose
edges can be combined to form $K_t$.  If $m \geq t$, we say $T$
\emph{divides} $K_m$ if $E(K_m)$ can be partitioned into copies of the
graphs in $T$ with each $G_i$ used at least once, and we call such a
partition a \emph{$T$-multidecomposition}.  In this talk, we determine
$T$-multidecompositions of complete graphs, where $T$ is a graph-triple of
order 6. Moreover, we determine maximum multipackings and minimum
multicoverings when $K_m$ does not admit a multidecomposition.

Title:  On Random $k$-Out Graphs with Preferential Attachment 
Abstract:  We generalize a model of Hansen and Jaworski for random mappings
which exhibit preferential attachment to a mapping $[n]\mapsto[n]^k$ - or,
equivalently, a random digraph $M_{n,k}^{\alpha}$ with labeled arcs and
uniform out-degree $k$. Each vertex starts with some weight $\alpha>0$; each
vertex chooses $k$ images, one at a time in a fixed order, with probability
of choosing a given vertex proportional to its current weight; and the
weight of the chosen vertex increases by 1 before the next decision is made.
The limiting case $M_{n,k}^{\infty}$ is a uniformly random $k$-out digraph
with labeled arcs.

We establish a limiting distribution for the vertex connectivity of the
graph obtained from $M_{n,k}^{\alpha}$ by ignoring loops, multiple edges,
and arc directions. We also seek to answer the question: how fast must
$\alpha$ grow (relative to $n$) in order to make the difference between
$M_{n,k}^{\alpha}$ and $M_{n,k}^{\infty}$ asymptotically negligible?
Measuring with the total variation distance, we establish
$\alpha=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ as a sharp threshold for this behavior.

Title:  Tuza's Conjecture for Graphs of Max Average Degree Less than 7 

Abstract:  Suppose I wish to make a graph $G$ triangle-free by removing a
small
number of edges.  An obvious obstruction is the presence of a large
set of edge-disjoint triangles, since I must remove one edge from each
triangle. On the other hand, removing all the edges in a maximal set
of edge-disjoint triangles clearly makes $G$ triangle-free.
\emph{Tuza's conjecture} states that the worst-case number of edges
that must be removed is somewhere between these extremes: if $\tau(G)$
is the number of edges that must be removed to make $G$ triangle-free
and $\nu(G)$ is the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in $G$,
then Tuza's conjecture states that $\tau(G) \leq 2\nu(G)$. Using the
method of discharging, we show that Tuza's conjecture holds whenever
the maximum average degree $\mathrm{Mad}(G) < 7$. This subsumes
several earlier results and represents the first application of
discharging to this problem.

Title:  Pairs of forbidden subgraphs for pancyclicity
Abstract:  The Matthew-Sumner Conjecture claims that every 4-connected,
claw-free graph contains a hamiltonian cycle.  This conjecture has provided
the impetus for a great deal of research into structural properties of
claw-free graphs, and in particular, pancyclicity.  While it is known that
forbidding the claw is an insufficient condition to imply pancyclicity of
4-connected graphs, we look to forbid more substructures to obtain this end.
In this talk we will present a characterization of the pairs of forbidden
subgraphs that imply pancyclicity for 4-connected graphs.  This extends a
result of Gould, {\L}uczak, and Pfender for 3-connected graphs.  (Joint work
with James Carraher, Michael Ferrara, and Timothy Morris)

Title:  An Algorithmic Approach to Raising the Lower Bound of $R(5,5)$ 
Abstract:  The primary focus of this talk is to explore some basic methods
for pushing the lower bound on the classical Ramsey number $R(5,5)$ from
$43$ to $44$.  Interestingly enough, we can phrase the problem in the
following way: Is it possible to have an arrangement of $43$ people in a
room such that no $5$ are \textit{either} mutual acquaintances \textit{or}
mutual strangers (a question that perhaps gave rise to the informal
description of this problem as the ``Party Problem'').  First, I explore the
simple brute force method involving testing $2^{903}$ configurations of
$2$-colorings of the edges of $K_{43}$, the complete graph on $43$ vertices.
Next I discuss some simplifications to this approach, including attempting
to exploit symmetry in configurations to eliminate graphs to test.  Finally,
I discuss the approach involving extending an existing solution on one less
vertex, drastically eliminating the number of graphs to be searched to
$2^{42}$. Having been unsuccessful in using my algorithm to raise the lower
bound of $R(5,5)$, I discuss some rationalizations for my ``failure'' and an
argument for $R(5,5)=43$. I will start with a description and history of the
problem, continue with a description of my approach, and finish by outlining
my results.
