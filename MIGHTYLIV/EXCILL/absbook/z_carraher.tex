\endtitle
Let $G$ be an Eulerian digraph with a fixed edge-coloring (not necessarily proper).  A compatible circuit $T$ is an Eulerian circuit of $G$ such that no consecutive edges in the circuit have the same color.  We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a compatible circuit in Eulerian digraphs that do not contain vertices of outdegree three.
