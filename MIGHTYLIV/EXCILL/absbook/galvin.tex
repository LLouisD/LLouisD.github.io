\title{Some extremal questions for coloring}
\endtitle
The focus of this talk will be the following extremal enumerative question: which graph in a given family admits the most proper $q$-colorings? For the family of graphs with fixed order and size, this question was asked independently by Linial and Wilf in the mid 1980's, and has still not been completely resolved. More recently, it has been asked for various other families such as trees, graphs with given minimum degree, and regular graphs. The talk will be a mixture of results and open questions.
