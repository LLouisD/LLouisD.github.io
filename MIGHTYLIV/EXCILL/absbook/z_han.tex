\endtitle
A loose Hamilton cycle in 3-uniform hypergraphs (3-graphs) is a spanning cycle in which consecutive edges intersect in a single vertex. Recently, Buss, H\`an and Schacht proved that every 3-graph $H$ on $n$ vertices ($n$ even, large enough) with the minimum vertex degree $\delta_1(H) \\ge (\frac 7{16}+o(1))\binom n2$, then $H$ contains a loose Hamilton cycle. We improve the result by giving exact minimum degree thresholds. We prove that every 3-graph $H$ on $n$ vertices ($n$ even, large enough) with minimum vertex degree $\delta_1(H)\ge \binom{n-1}2 - \binom{\frac34 n}2 + 2$ contains a loose Hamilton cycle.
