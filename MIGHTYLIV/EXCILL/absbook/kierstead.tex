Hajnal and Szemer\'edi proved that every graph $G$ with $|G|=ks$ and $\delta(G)\ge\ k(s-1)$ contains $k$ disjoint $s$-cliques; moreover this degree bound is optimal.  We extend their theorem to directed graphs by showing  that every directed graph $\vv G$ with $|\vv G|=ks$ and $\delta(\vv G)\ge2k(s-1)-1$ contains $k$ disjoint transitive tournaments on $s$ vertices, where $\delta(\vv G)=\min_{v\in V(\vv G)}d^-(v)+d^+(v)$. Our result implies the Hajnal-Szemer\'edi Theorem, and its degree bound is optimal. We also make some conjectures regarding an even more general result for multigraphs and partitioning into other tournaments. One of these conjectures is supported by an asymptotic result.

This is joint work with  Andrzej Czygrinow, Louis DeBiasio and Theodore Molla.
