\title{Finitely forcible graphons}
\endtitle

Recently, Lovasz and Szegedy have initiated investigation of limits of
convergent sequences of dense graphs which are determined by finitely
many subgraph densities, called finitely forcible graphons. They have
also introduced a notion of a topological space of typical points of a
graphon.

We will present examples of finitely forcible graphons for which the
corresponding space has arbitrary finite dimension. For all previously
known examples this dimension was equal to 0 or 1. We will also show
that the infinite lexicographic power of any prime graph is finitely
forcible, partially answering a question of Lov\'asz and Szegedy.
