\title{Coverings by monochromatic pieces}
\endtitle

Our main goal is to study the following problem:
Given fixed positive integers $s$, $t$ and a
family of graphs $F$, what is the maximum number of vertices
that can be covered by the vertices of no more than $s$
monochromatic members of F in every $t$-edge coloring of the complete
graph on $n$ vertices? This problem unites two classical problems;
at one end of the spectrum ($s=1$) we have the Ramsey problem,
while at the other end we have cover problems. But there
are some interesting problems "in-between" as well.
Most of the results are joint with Andr\'as Gy\'arf\'as and/or Endre Szemer\'edi.
