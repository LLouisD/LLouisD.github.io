\title{Counting and packing Hamilton cycles}
\endtitle
We present a general method, based on estimates for permanets of matrices, for counting and packing Hamilton cycles in dense graphs and oriented graphs. We utilize this approach to prove several new extremal results, and also to derive new and  conceptually simple(r) proofs of some known results in this area.\\
