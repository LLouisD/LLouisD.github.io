\title{On Two Hamiltonian Problems For Triple Systems}
\endtitle

I will discuss two problems (with only partial solutions) on the existence of Hamiltonian cycles in $k$-uniform hypergraphs, or $k$-graphs for short, with emphasis on  triple systems ($k=3$).

The first problem asks for the minimum number of edges in a ma\-xi\-mally non-Hamiltonian $k$-graph -- the so called \emph{saturation number} (joint work with Andrzej {\.Z}ak). The second, Dirac-type problem, is to determine the  \emph{minimum} vertex degree guaranteeing a Hamiltonian cycle in a $k$-graph (joint work with Vojtech R\"odl, Mathias Schacht and  Endre Szemer\'edi).
