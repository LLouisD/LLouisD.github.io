\title{Proof of the 1-factorization and Hamilton decomposition conjectures}
\endtitle

We prove the following results (via a unified approach) for all sufficiently large $n$:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] [\emph{$1$-factorization conjecture}]
Suppose  that $n$ is even and $D\geq 2\lceil n/4\rceil -1$. 
Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a decomposition into perfect matchings.
Equivalently, $\chi'(G)=D$.
\item[(ii)] [\emph{Hamilton decomposition conjecture}]
Suppose that $D \ge   \lfloor n/2 \rfloor $.
Then every $D$-regular graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has a decomposition
into Hamilton cycles and at most one perfect matching.
\item[(iii)] [\emph{Optimal packings of Hamilton cycles}] Suppose that $G$ is a graph on $n$ vertices with
minimum degree $\delta\ge n/2$.
Then $G$ contains at least $ (n-2)/8$ edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles.
\end{itemize}
According to Dirac, (i) was first raised in the 1950's.
(ii) and (iii) answer questions of Nash-Williams from 1970.
All of the above bounds are best possible
