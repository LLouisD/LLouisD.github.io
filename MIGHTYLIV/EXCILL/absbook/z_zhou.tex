\endtitle

We call a digraph $D = (V,E)$ a maximal $m$-free digraph if only if $D$ has no cycles of length at most $m$ and adding any ordered pair $(u, v)\in E$ will create a cycle of
length at most $m$. In this poster, we will show that the class of digraphs share similar properties with tournament digraphs and this ``maximality'' condition can be used to get better approximation results for some extremal problems in digraphs.
