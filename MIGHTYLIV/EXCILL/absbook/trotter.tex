\title{Tree-width and Dimension}
\endtitle

Over the last 30 years, researchers have
investigated connections between
dimension for posets and planarity for graphs.  In this
talk, we discuss quite recent work where this line
of research has been extended to the structural
graph theory parameter tree-width.  In particular,
we motivate the following theorem: The dimension of a finite poset
is bounded in terms of its height and the tree-width
of its cover graph.

This research is joint with Gwena\"{e}l Joret,
Piotr Micek, Kevin G. Milans, Bartosz Walczak and
Ruidong Wang.
