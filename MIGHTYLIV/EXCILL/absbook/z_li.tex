\endtitle
In 1979 Frankl conjectured that in a finite non-trivial union closed
collection of sets there has to be an element that belongs to at least half
the sets. Piotr Wjcik introduced normalized union closed family and showed that the original conjecture is equivalent to for any normalized union closed family $\mathcal{F}$ with $|\mathcal{F}|=n$, there exists a generator $G$ of $\mathcal{F}$ such that $|G|\geq \frac{|\mathcal{F}|}{2}$. In our paper, we will show that the if the family $\mathcal{F}$ is the minimal counter example to the above conjecture, then $|\mathcal{F}|$ is odd and it has a generator with size $\frac{|\mathcal{F}|-1}{2}$. 
Moreover, let $G(\mathcal{F})$ be the family of all generators of $\mathcal{F}$. We will show that $|G(\mathcal{F})|\geq \frac{|\mathcal{F}|-1}{2}$ is a sufficient condition for the above conjecture.
