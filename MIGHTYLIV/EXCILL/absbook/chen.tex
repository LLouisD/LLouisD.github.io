\title{Reed-Frost transition on dense graphs}
\endtitle

The classic Reed-Frost stochastic epidemic process on a population of $n$ elements with probability $p$  can be viewed as a percolation on a complete graph with a given number of initially infected vertices.  At each step each infected vertex infects an undeleted and uninfected vertex independently with probability $p$, and all previously infected vertices  are removed. The process stops if there is no new infected vertex. The {\it percolation time} is the time $t$ when all vertices have been infected or $+\infty$.  

In this talk, we extend the the Reed-Frost process from complete graphs to general graphs and obtain a few sufficient conditions on the density of graphs and probability such that with high probability that the percolation time is bounded above by a constant. We also notice that these conditions are best possible in some sense. 

This is joint work with { Hendricus van der Holst, Nana Li,  Songling Shan} and {Ping Yang}.
