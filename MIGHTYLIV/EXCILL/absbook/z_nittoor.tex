\endtitle

The focus of the research is on mathematical building blocks for defining search problems in order to find optimal graphs, where optimality defined in terms of girth of the graph. We introduce a notation for regular bipartite graphs called Balanced Tanner Units (BTUs) . Several enumeration problems for labeled and unlabeled BTUs have been introduced. A general algorithm for enumerating all non-isomorphic (m, 2) BTUs has been developed along with a mathematical proof for its completeness. An algorithm to generate the partition associated with two compatible permutations has been introduced. Several formulae for the number of compatible permutations corresponding to a specified partition have been derived. A family of labeled (m,r) BTUs have been introduced and an upper bound on the number of non-isomorphic graphs in this family has been derived and raise open questions for girth maximum (m, r) BTU. We further calculate of the optimal partition parameters and prove that the girth maximum (m, r) Balanced Tanner Unit lies in family of BTUs specified by them using a series of proved results and thus creates a framework for specifying a search problem for finding the girth maximum BTU. A search algorithm which is based upon exhaustive enumeration has been implemented and has been found to be in EXPTIME.
