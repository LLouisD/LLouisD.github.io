\title{Flag Algebras: an Interim Report}
\endtitle

This talk will mostly be a survey of concrete results in extremal combinatorics obtained with the method of flag algebras. But our presentation will also be preceded, interleaved 
and concluded with a few general digressions about the method itself.
