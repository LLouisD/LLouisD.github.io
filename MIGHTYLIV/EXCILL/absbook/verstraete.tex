\title{On independent sets in locally sparse hypergraphs}
\endtitle

In this talk I will discuss various approaches and constructions for finding maximal independent sets in locally sparse hypergraphs, in particular, for linear hypergraphs and for triangle-free hypergraphs. 

Joint work with Dhruv Mubayi and Sasha Kostochka
