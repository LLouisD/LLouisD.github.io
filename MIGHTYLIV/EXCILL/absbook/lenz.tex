\title{Spectral extremal problems for hypergraphs}
\endtitle

Since the foundational results of Thomason and Chung-Graham-Wilson on
quasirandom graphs over 20 years ago, there has been a lot of effort by many
researchers to extend the theory to hypergraphs. One key new aspect in the
theory is the development of hypergraph eigenvalues, and I will describe 
some recent results on the first and second largest eigenvalues of a hypergraph.
This is joint work with Dhruv Mubayi and Peter Keevash.
